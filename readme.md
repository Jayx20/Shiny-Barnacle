<h1>Shiny Barnacle</h1>
<h3>What is this?</h3>
This is a project just for me to mess around with, using GLFW and GLEW for 3d graphics. Specifically, I'm interested in making voxel graphics and learning about how to create shaders with cool lighting effects and stuff. Essentially, this is a bit of a playground for me to get more familiar with OpenGL. (and C++ in general) I decided to start this mess after I used LWJGL (a java implementation of GLFW/OpenGL, essentially) to make some 2d graphics and physics, and realized how much I enjoyed working on graphics.
<h3>Why is this named Shiny Barnacle?</h3>
I wasn't exactly sure what I wanted to do with this project yet, besides that it would be a C++ project with some 3d graphics. I was going to name the repo Unnamed-Project, but github suggested I name it Shiny-Barnacle, and I thought it sounded like a cool codename.
<h3>So this project has no direction or goal?</h3>
For the most part, yes - which of course makes it hard to work towards any kind of polished product, but that is fine as I mostly just want to learn. I do have a few ideas as to what I might do with voxel graphics, but I don't really want to get into those ideas until I have actually begun working on them.
<h3>Can I download and run the project just for fun?</h3>
Well sure, but right now portability is a bit awkward. I am focused on making sure I can build it on at least windows and linux, but I don't really know how well the executable files will work in different environments than my own. In the future, I will focus on getting CMake to work in all kinds of different environments, so you can build the project from source yourself just using the CMake and make commands.

<h3>Who are you?</h3>
I am Jayx20, basically I just program in my free time because I enjoy it.
I've messed with different C++ libraries for simple 2d graphics in the past (SFML, then SDL, then GLFW/GLEW), but this is the first time I have used 3d graphics.
